[_Why care how your tools work? (Fun Fun Function)_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_HA1JPz7X4)
Always good to take a step back and think about _why_, rather than just _what_ or _how_.

[_All you need to know about CSS-in-JS_](https://hackernoon.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-css-in-js-984a72d48ebc)
Main takeaways:

- CSS was written for multi-page applications, CSS-in-JS is trying to work for SPAs while staying as efficient
- Inline styling isn't efficient, messes up CSS specificity, etc. but CSS-in-JS compiles into CSS with classnames that optimizes everything and avoids overlaps, duplications, overly nested selectors, etc.
- Gives you access to React/Vue/etc. state if you configure it that way.
- CSS has one global namespace. CSS-in-JS gives you local namespaces.
- Automatic vendor prefixing (-webkit-, -moz-, etc.)
- Styled Components (works great for React Native too!!), JSS, Emotion.js
